                Implemented a REST API for accessing and manipulating translation assets. These services were used in an
                overhauled translation tool UI, and the UI of any internal tool that required access to read or modify
                translation assets, or their metadata.
            </li>
            <li>Designed and implemented the translator app used by contracted translators.
                Efficient translation was facilitated by an fast and uncluttered UI, and keyboard shortcuts.
                High quality, consistent translation work was facilitated by access to translation memory,
                glossary definitions for key terms, contextual information,
                translation instructions, and a discussions system.
            </li>

            <li>Designed and implemented a revised job management workflow and interface for translators.</li>

        <h4>B.Sc. Hons (Computer Science) @ UCD Dublin<span class="pull-right">2004-2011</span> </h4>
        <p>
            The core module in this course focused on many core CS concepts such as data structures, algorithms, formal
            logic, group theory, algebra, foundations of computing, computer architecture, artificial intelligence,
            computer graphics and software engineering. In addition to the core subjects I took modules in  parallel and cluster computing, electric and electronic circuits, applied maths, data mining, genetic algorithms and calculus.
            Project work included developing an arcade game, chat and email applications, a location based Android app.

            Investigated the use of clustering techniques to semantically group search results from a corpus of professional profiles.
            The research was done by indexing the data with Lucene, and clustering results using a variety clustering algorithms.
