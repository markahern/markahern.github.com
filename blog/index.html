  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although the workload of my Final year modules has really stepped up a notch over the last couple of weeks, I&rsquo;ve been trying to keep the web based android testing project moving.</p>

<p>In terms of progress, it is now possible to log in to the emulator with multiple users. Already at this early stage it seems that performance is going to be a big issue the testing service needs to be capable of providing several users with a responsive emulator, and on a Small size amazon machine, 2 users at once leads to poor performance on the server side.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to be able to talk about my project at last tuesday&rsquo;s GTUG meeting.  I was encouraged to see there was definite interest in the project among the 40+ strong google tech users in attendance. In particular, when chatting after, I got some more ideas of use cases for the project.  These are always useful because I can keep them in the back of my mind as design decisions are made in the course of the project. I have attached my slides: <a href="/images/GTUGTalk1.pdf">GTUG &ndash; Web Based Testing of Android Apps on Amazon EC2 </a>.</p>

<p>Next steps are to look into designing / implementing a workflow around getting apps on the emulator to test, and making it easy for testers to get to testing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In June Two years ago I embarked on a trip with five others to the French Alps, but due to rainy weather conditions we were &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to spend our week in Val Sesia in the Italian Alps. It was here I found what is to date still my favourite place in the world to go kayaking. When the opportunity to spend 15 days in the region presented itself  this May I jumped at it.</p>

<p>When planning, myself, Simon &ldquo;Every waking hour must be spent on the river&rdquo; Rowan and Peter &ldquo;All About Chemistry&rdquo; O&#8217;Sullivan left absolutely nothing to chance. This trip was to run like a well oiled machine. Of course the machine was to be assembled on a slightly ad hoc basis, with the only things pre-planned being 3 return flights to Bergamo Airport and a car to get us and (somehow) our boats around. We also brought along some top end gear to document the trip (read: Simon&rsquo;s compact camera).</p>

<p>As they are wont to do, the Italian car rental company attempted to offload a Fiat estate on us that was held together by Pritt Stick glue. Luckily we persuaded them to instead give us a kick-ass Renault Megane estate, with a diesel engine, only 7000km on the clock and sweet, sweet roof rails. This car was too good for us, and we did not treat her well. We loaded the boats onto our supermarket purchased roof racks and set the GPS for Campertogno. The journey was uneventful and absolutely free of exit-missing fuck-ups.</p>

<p>On the 15th of May, the day after we had flown in we were at the put on of our first &ldquo;warm-up&rdquo; trip, chosen due to the lack of a need for a car drop, the beautiful Gronda and the Sorba Slides.</p>

<!-- [caption id="attachment_63" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Peter bimbles down the third sorba slide"] -->


<p><a href="/images/DSCN20021.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" title="Third Sorba Slide" src="/images/DSCN20021-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>We were all a bit rusty and took the trip really slowly. The flow on Gronda was perhaps a little low, and the Sorba Slides at a really cushy level. It was a great confidence builder to start the trip with, as well as a great introduction to the style of river scouting and paddling we would be doing for the duration of the holiday.</p>

<!-- [caption id="attachment_64" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Simon just after running Piode. Unfortunately a good rescue position was preferred over a good camera angle for this drop"] -->


<p><a href="/images/DSCN2022.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" title="DSCN2022" src="/images/DSCN2022-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Day two saw us lacking in a car drop again, as the campsite in Camptertogno was still fairly quiet. We decided to have a blast down the Home Run: the middle section of the Sesia. The tone of the trip to follow was set when we all decided to run the intimidating looking drop under the bridge at the town of Piode, something I had walked during my previous trip to the region.</p>

<div class="mceTemp"><span style="line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;">With two top-class grade IV rivers under our belt, the cobwebs were well and truly blown off. That night more paddlers started arriving at the campsite. At dinner in the on-site restaurant we got talking to Dominik and Marco, a couple of Swiss lads</span> with only one car, over an after dinner Grappa. This tasty (like molten iron) and delicate (as in your stomach after drinking it) apéritif was to define our alliance of Europe&#8217;s neutral nations. So the five of us decided that we&#8217;d give the Sorba Gorge a go the next day; but Simon Westgarth, an expert on the area, told us it&#8217;d be crap so we headed for the classic Egua instead.</span></div>




<!-- [caption id="attachment_96" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Auto-Boof on the Egua. Auto-Boof sounds funny when Swiss-Germans say it."] -->


<p><a href="/images/DSCN2069.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" title="DSCN2069" src="/images/DSCN2069-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>As with everything we had done here, its high gradient meant we were a bit nervous on the way to the trip. Luckily Peter had brought along Semisonic &ndash; All About Chemistry on CD to get us psyched up! Boy did he love that song. The Swiss boys had done it the day before which sped up matters a bit. We enjoyed it so much we ran it three times, what a river!</p>

<!-- [caption id="attachment_66" align="alignright" width="225" caption="Yours truly on another drop that I had walked two years before."] -->


<p><a href="/images/DSCN2071-e1287701807720.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" title="DSCN2071" src="/images/DSCN2071-e1287701807720-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>It was the perfect start to the trip, we had gotten on a Grade IV river every day,  met a couple of likeminded paddlers to run a few rivers with, found Peter&rsquo;s CD collection to be a perfect compliment to the outstanding Italian radio, and most importantly hadn&rsquo;t yet resorted to paddling with any tans!</p>

<p>More to come!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whenever I start on a project I always find it nice to get something working as soon as posible. Below is a screenshot of an android emulator which I&rsquo;m accessing using a browser, which is definitely a nice first step and something to kick on from. Particularly pleasing was how responsive the emulator is, and how quickly it boots up. (Much faster than on my 2010 Macbook Pro.</p>

<p>The next steps are to work on having an android emulator boot and load an application as soon as a user logs in, as well as supporting multiple users at once.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For my final year project I am working on creating an environment which can be used to easily test android applications via a web application on which the android emulator along with the application to be tested has already been set up and is accessible via a web browser. Here is the <a href="http://www.csi.ucd.ie/content/development-cloud-based-android-testing-framework">full project specification</a>.</p>

<p>I will be blogging about my work in order to catalogue my efforts and also it may serve as a resource for people who come across problems that I solve in the course of the project.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already gotten started and in between lectures and other college assignments I have been working on getting an android emulator up and running on an Ubuntu Machine Image running on Amazon&rsquo;s <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Elastic Compute Cloud</a>. I hope to be able to access the emulator using <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a> and <a href="http://guacamole.sourceforge.net/">guacamole</a>. As it stands I am having difficulty getting x11vnc working, and guacamole is throwing me the following error:</p>

<blockquote>Error connecting to server: net.sourceforge.guacamole.vnc.VNCException: Could not write to / read from socket (network error).</blockquote>


<p style="text-align: left;">Not exactly much to report in the way of progress but I suppose it&#8217;s no harm to start blogging about whats happening from the very start!</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">Coming soon on Mark&#8217;s Fourth Year Project Blog: A screenshot of me using an android emulator thats hosted on the cloud via my web browser(I hope)!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in college again, and no doubt back to the weekly deadlines aswell! The first week has been relatively quiet but all the subjects that have had lectures so far seem like they will be quite Interesting. In particular, I&rsquo;ll be having my first foray into assembly language and will be developing for a mobile phone for the first time.</p>

<p>Along with college I am doing my best to find myself a coding internship for the summer, so that I can get a real taste of what its like to work as a programmer.</p>

<p>Last weekend I got loads of paddling done. On Friday myself and Eoinor headed for Wicklow with a van and a bike, and we hit snow melt! We got the <a href="http://www.irishwhitewater.com/river_guide/river.php?id=280" target="_blank">Dargle</a> in at a sweet level and we also found time to fall down a medium/high <a href="http://www.irishwhitewater.com/river_guide/river.php?id=317">Glenmacnass</a> with snow covered rocks afterwards! Unfortunately Our crew of 2 didn&rsquo;t include a photographer, so we only have this picture of the get on:</p>

<p>Then after missing out on the boating on Saturday, I got another 2 runs down the Dargle on Sunday, one of which was in a massive 13 person group!</p>

<p>Next weekend I am doing the Level 5 Skills Training course (water dependent), so I can start logging hours on these runs!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had an awesome 3 days of kayaking in Kerry between Christmas and New Years. It was nice to get back in my boat after having to take a short break from paddling due to college. I have a few pics of the runs, courtesy of <a title="Kyle's Photography Site" href="http://blog.kyletunneyphotography.com" target="_blank">Kyle Tunney</a>.</p>

<p>On the 29th December, myself and a few friends hit the <a title="Middle Roughty River Guide" href="http://irishwhitewater.com/river_guide/river.php?id=281" target="_blank">Middle Roughty</a> which had a healthy amount of water on it! I had done this river at a similar level 2 years ago, but I forgot just how many fun drops are on it! Everyone cruised down, bar the 2nd slot drop, which we all walked. Despite the freezing weather we had a blast!</p>

<p><a href="/images/P1000057.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" src="/images/P1000057-300x225.jpg" alt="Group Photo before running the Middle Roughty" width="300" height="225" /><!-- <br>Matt, Eoinor,Kyle, Mark  and Caoimhe &mdash;></a></p>

<br>


<p><a href="/images/P1000080.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" title="P1000080" src="/images/P1000080-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><!-- <br>The first slot drop, with enough water to completely avoid the slot! &mdash;></a></p>

<p>The next day, despite a <em>very</em> slow start in the morning, I got my first run down one of the classic Irish Creeks: <a title="The Flesk River Guide" href="http://www.irishwhitewater.com/river_guide/river.php?id=261" target="_blank">The Flesk</a>. The river turned out to be at a perfect level for a first run down. Of the five of us that got on, 2 of lad&rsquo;s had done the river before, and they showed us down. Despite the odd ropey line from the Flesk Virgins, everyone seemed happy with how they had paddled. Probably the most fun I have had on a river in Ireland!</p>

<p><a href="/images/P1000122.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" title="P1000122" src="/images/P1000122-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /><!-- <br>Me, somewhere, running the first gorge. &mdash;></a></p>

<br>


<p>Then it was back to the Roughty, and this time it was much lower. The river was completely different to how I had done it before. What it had lost in volume and speed , it gained in more technical rapids, with a few rapids appearing that were completely washed out at the level from 2 days ago. Along with Peter, it was myself and Kyle&rsquo;s turn to show some folk down a new river!</p>

<p>This time around the second slot drop was a much less intimidating prospect, so I gave it a go.  Once you were lined up right at the top, you just popped through the slot handy enough. It&rsquo;s nice to do something you&rsquo;ve walked before, even it if is at a totally different level!</p>

<p>Again there was no drama or swims on the trip, apart from Finn doing some crazy seal launches in order to avoid some much safer rapids!</p>

<p><a href="/images/P1000147.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" title="roughtyday3geton" src="/images/P1000147-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><!-- <br>Kyle, Peter, Niall, Finn, Noodles, Mark and Karen at the Get On. &mdash;></a></p>

<br>


<p>What a great 3 days after over a month off the water!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back, when I started doing C++ for an Object Orinted Programming Course I did in UCD, I was unable to compile a simple hello world program. I found the solution to the problem in the comments section of this <a href="http://blog.code-head.com/eclipse-launch-failed-binary-not-found-and-netbeans">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>On the blog, Bert said:</p>

<blockquote>Found the culprit. Standard g++ compilation has moved to 64 bit instead of 32 bit on Snow Leopard. Mach-0 can’t read 64 bit binaries yet though. Just change your compiler and linking flags in Eclipse and add “-arch i386″. Works like a charm now.</blockquote>


<p>To do this, Go to project Properties, C/C++ Build, Settings then click on Miscellaneous under Mac OS X C++ Linker and put “-arch i386″ in the Linker Flag Box and then go to Miscellaneous under gcc c++ compiler and put the same: “-arch i386″ in the Other Flags box.</p>

<p>This solved the problem for me! Hopefully this is better than having the solution buried in the comments section of a blog!</p>
