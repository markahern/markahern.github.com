<div class="entry-content"><p>In June Two years ago I embarked on a trip with five others to the French Alps, but due to rainy weather conditions we were &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to spend our week in Val Sesia in the Italian Alps. It was here I found what is to date still my favourite place in the world to go kayaking. When the opportunity to spend 15 days in the region presented itself  this May I jumped at it.</p>

<p>When planning, myself, Simon &ldquo;Every waking hour must be spent on the river&rdquo; Rowan and Peter &ldquo;All About Chemistry&rdquo; O&#8217;Sullivan left absolutely nothing to chance. This trip was to run like a well oiled machine. Of course the machine was to be assembled on a slightly ad hoc basis, with the only things pre-planned being 3 return flights to Bergamo Airport and a car to get us and (somehow) our boats around. We also brought along some top end gear to document the trip (read: Simon&rsquo;s compact camera).</p>

<p>As they are wont to do, the Italian car rental company attempted to offload a Fiat estate on us that was held together by Pritt Stick glue. Luckily we persuaded them to instead give us a kick-ass Renault Megane estate, with a diesel engine, only 7000km on the clock and sweet, sweet roof rails. This car was too good for us, and we did not treat her well. We loaded the boats onto our supermarket purchased roof racks and set the GPS for Campertogno. The journey was uneventful and absolutely free of exit-missing fuck-ups.</p>

<p>On the 15th of May, the day after we had flown in we were at the put on of our first &ldquo;warm-up&rdquo; trip, chosen due to the lack of a need for a car drop, the beautiful Gronda and the Sorba Slides.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/images/DSCN20021.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" title="Third Sorba Slide" src="/blog/images/DSCN20021-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>We were all a bit rusty and took the trip really slowly. The flow on Gronda was perhaps a little low, and the Sorba Slides at a really cushy level. It was a great confidence builder to start the trip with, as well as a great introduction to the style of river scouting and paddling we would be doing for the duration of the holiday.</p>

<!-- [caption id="attachment_64" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Simon just after running Piode. Unfortunately a good rescue position was preferred over a good camera angle for this drop"] -->


<p><a href="/blog/images/DSCN2022.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" title="DSCN2022" src="/blog/images/DSCN2022-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Day two saw us lacking in a car drop again, as the campsite in Camptertogno was still fairly quiet. We decided to have a blast down the Home Run: the middle section of the Sesia. The tone of the trip to follow was set when we all decided to run the intimidating looking drop under the bridge at the town of Piode, something I had walked during my previous trip to the region.</p>

<div class="mceTemp"><span style="line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;">With two top-class grade IV rivers under our belt, the cobwebs were well and truly blown off. That night more paddlers started arriving at the campsite. At dinner in the on-site restaurant we got talking to Dominik and Marco, a couple of Swiss lads</span> with only one car, over an after dinner Grappa. This tasty (like molten iron) and delicate (as in your stomach after drinking it) apéritif was to define our alliance of Europe&#8217;s neutral nations. So the five of us decided that we&#8217;d give the Sorba Gorge a go the next day; but Simon Westgarth, an expert on the area, told us it&#8217;d be crap so we headed for the classic Egua instead.</span></div>

<p>As with everything we had done here, its high gradient meant we were a bit nervous on the way to the trip. Luckily Peter had brought along Semisonic &ndash; All About Chemistry on CD to get us psyched up! Boy did he love that song. The Swiss boys had done it the day before which sped up matters a bit. We enjoyed it so much we ran it three times, what a river!</p>

<!-- [caption id="attachment_66" align="alignright" width="225" caption="Yours truly on another drop that I had walked two years before."] -->


<p><a href="/blog/images/DSCN2071-e1287701807720.jpg"><img class="img-polaroid" title="DSCN2071" src="/blog/images/DSCN2071-e1287701807720-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>It was the perfect start to the trip, we had gotten on a Grade IV river every day,  met a couple of likeminded paddlers to run a few rivers with, found Peter&rsquo;s CD collection to be a perfect compliment to the outstanding Italian radio, and most importantly hadn&rsquo;t yet resorted to paddling with any tans!</p>

<p>More to come!</p>
