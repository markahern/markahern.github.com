        </h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Overhauled the processing and delivery of string resource files. Replaced procedural code with unit tested, object oriented code. This work significantly reduced the amount of support issues being raised from customers and made changing and extending this part of the system much easier.
            <li>Implemented a REST API for accessing and manipulating translation assets. These services are core to front end code that allows users to interact with these assets.
            <li>Completely redesigned and implemented our translation web app based on feedback from translators. The result included keyboard shortcuts, extensive contextual information for translators, and the ability to show large projects on a single page.
            <li>Participated in a complete redesign of how customer translation projects are managed.
            <li>Fostered modern and pragmatic web development practices and technologies.
            <li>Triaged and fixed production issues, and provided technical support for translators and developers using the service.

                Investigated the use of clustering techniques to semantically group search results from a corpus of
                professional profiles. Applied a variety clustering algorithms to a Lucene index of the corpus, and provided an analysis of the results.
